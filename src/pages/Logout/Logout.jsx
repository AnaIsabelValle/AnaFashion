  /*
   * This component is responsible for logging the user out and redirecting 
   * them to the home page. Its primary function is to handle the logout process
   * and provide the user with a farewell message.
   * 1.-Logout and Redirect:
   * It uses the useAuth hook to access the authentication state and the logoutUser 
   * function to log the user out.
   * It utilizes the useNavigate hook to access the navigation function.
   * The useEffect function is used to execute code after the component is mounted.
   * In this case, it checks if the user is authenticated.
   * If the user is authenticated, logoutUser is called to log the user out.
   * If the user is not authenticated, the user is redirected to the home page using navigate('/').
   * The effect's dependency is left empty [], meaning the effect will run only once after the component is mounted.
   * 2.- Farewell Message:
   * Within the component, a farewell message is displayed thanking the user for their visit and saying "Goodbye...".
   * A link is provided allowing the user to return to the home page.
